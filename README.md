# 2026 First Year Council Projects
The First-Year Council is a cohort of first-year students within IEEE focused on developing professional, interpersonal, and technical skills. This leadership position is designed to expose students to various fields within engineering and prepare them for their professional careers dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. 

Each year, students are assigned to groups and tasked with developing a project that provides a practical benefit to the community. Projects are to be completed within a 9-month period, from September to May. Students follow the engineering design process throughout this project to identify the needs of specific stakeholders and deliver a product that meets outlined constraints and defined objectives.
