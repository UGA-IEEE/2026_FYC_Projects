# Project Updates
As part of an upcoming meeting, the groups will be showcasing their projects to all of their peers in a FYC meeting. 

As a general outline, the group should: 
- Create a ~10 minute presentation, utilizing non-serif fonts
- Roles of each group member and advisor
- Introduction of the group's project, what it entails, and what is required to realize the full system
- Tasks completed to help with the development of the project

## Criteria
The structure of the presentation is flexible, but it should discuss what is on the general outline. When discussing some of the tasks, utilize graphics to help the audience understand the background of the task. A typical discussion of the task can follow the structure of introduction, challenges faced, and verdict.  

## Tips
Here are some tips that could help the group when creating the presentation and how the group can be successful when presenting it.
1. The focus of the presentation is <b>YOU</b>. This means that your peers shouldn't have to read an essay to figure out what the project is about. Instead, present it in a way that keeps the audience engaged.
2. Use high-quality graphics. It would be disappointing to look at a blurry photo of the circuit that your group built for the project.
3. Utilize a professional presentation theme. This means that the chosen font should be readable at a reasonable size, the colors of the presentation are neutral, and presentation animations are kept minimal and only used to enhance or emphasize what is being talked about (e.g., changing the font color from white to dark gray to represent that it is not being talked about). 
4. Practice the presentation with your group. It is not fun for anyone when it is clear the presenters do not know what they are talking about, or their thoughts are unclear. No one gets to learn.
