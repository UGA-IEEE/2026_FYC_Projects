A karnaugh map is a special form of truth table which enables easier pattern recognition, good for circuit design with 4 inputs.  Draw a grid for one square for each column in the truth table, input values are coordinates for output value.  An expression can be derived from inspecting the karnaugh group, if B is 0 and output is 1 and the output is just 1, then that means the graph is redundant and can be expressed with just one.
