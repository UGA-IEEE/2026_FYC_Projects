Course Overview:  
This course introduces the scientific study of language, emphasizing such topics as the mental 
organization of grammar, the relationship between the study of language and other disciplines, and 
the relationship between language and its use in society. In order to provide a broad understanding 
of human language, this course covers major formal and functional subfields in Linguistics, 
including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, neurolinguistics, 
psycholinguistics, language acquisition, language change and language variation.

General Information and University Policies:  
Per the Linguistics department’s policy for this course, students are allowed 1 week of unexcused 
absences (2 classes for Tuesday/Thursday schedule), after which points will be deducted from 
overall participation grade. If there are more than 2 weeks (5 or more classes) of unexcused 
absences, this may result in an automatic failure of the class. Absences may be excused for UGA 
sanctioned athletic and academic events that are brought to the instructor’s attention prior to the 
event date. Otherwise, excused absences are up to the instructor’s discretion. Typically, excused 
absences are reserved for reasons (as judged by the instructor) that are urgent and unavoidable, so 
be aware that just because you inform your instructor of an absence in advance, that does not 
guarantee that it will be excused. 
Students may make up exams or turn in late assignments if they must miss class due to their 
required participation in a UGA sanctioned event, or if a documented illness prevents them from 
completing the work on time. I am willing to work with students on making up work or exams if I 
have been made aware of the situation beforehand. Make up exams will only be available during 
office hours.  
Students who need any type of accommodation should contact Accessibility and Testing (A&T), 
formerly the DRC. You are not required to disclose any disability-related information to me, but you 
are welcome to inform me if you think it will be beneficial (that information is 100% confidential). 
As a UGA student, you have agreed to abide by the university’s academic honesty policy, “A Culture 
of Honesty,” and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in 
“A Culture of Honesty” found at the following link: 
https://honesty.uga.edu/academic-honesty-policy/student-honor-code/. Lack of knowledge about 
the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for committing a violation. Students 
will be required to sign a statement reaffirming that they agree to abide by the university academic 
honesty policy when taking in-person exams. Questions related to the course assignments and the 
academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.  
Mental Health and Wellness Resources: 
If you or someone you know needs assistance, you are encouraged to contact Student Care and 
Outreach in the Division of Student Affairs at 706-542-8479 or visit 
https://sco.uga.edu. They will 
help you navigate any difficult circumstances you may be facing by connecting you with the 
appropriate resources or services. 
UGA has several resources for a student seeking mental health services, including
