# Deliverable 5 - Complete during Winter Break 
For the next few weeks, the deliverables will be structured differently. 
Instead of "hardware" and "software" deliverables, each task will be delegated for each person. 

## Everyone (except Owen)
1. Complete two CodingBat tasks per week in Python. If you do not know how to program, this is a great chance to learn. Add this to your OneNote. 

## Mary
1. Continue developing the CAD sketch of the alarm clock system. Represent everything - RP5, Screen, Pogo Pins, Wearable. Look online for the size of the components. Utilize layers to be able to differentiate from all working parts of the system.
2. Develop an initial mockup of the user interface that users will interact with on the clock. 
3. Develop an initial CAD sketch of the watch system. 

## Udaya
1. Write a report on what a Kalman filter does. This is a recursive method that can be used to further enhance signal processing.
2. Conduct research on important factors to good sleep. Look for age ranges the study covers, what types of data are most important, etc. Identify factors that **CAN** be measured by the hardware we have obtained. This means that you should continue to reference your own datasheets for the hardware on your BOM to complete this work. 

## Saud
1. Interface the speaker with the Raspberry Pi and the I2S module. Write the program to set 3 different volume levels, for now. Take a video of this, and upload it onto an unlisted link on YouTube, then put the link on the OneNote. 
2. Once the program is set to be able to control the speaker with 3 different volume levels, write the program to output sound every 5 seconds for a 2-second period of time. Take a video of this. 
3. Now, write the program to output sound for an indefinite amount of time until a user stops it based on a command. Write the program to take a user input for when it needs to ring (e.g. 5:00 PM).

## Owen
1. Complete two LeetCode problems per week. Upload to OneNote for proof.
2. Develop lightweight algorithms that iterate through a dataset. Preferably sleep-related data. Put all of this in the GitHub in a folder of your choice, and take note of it. 
3. Based on the algorithms, have some type of output (can be a `System.out.println` output for now) that shows the user what to do when a certain factor of their sleep is falling behind (example: user gets 6 hours of sleep but would be better off with 8). Take screenshots.
