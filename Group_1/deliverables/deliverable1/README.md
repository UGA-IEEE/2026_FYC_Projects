# Deliverable 1 - Week of 10/7/2025
Great job on the project introduction and keep up the good work!

## Group Goal of the Week
Now that the group has developed a project introduction, develop a Bill of Materials using the Excel template. Utilize Amazon and Digikey as the preferred vendors. Research different PPG sensors, RTC Modules, speakers, ESPs, accelerometers/gyroscopes, thermistors, and neodymium magnets, based on datasheets. To effectively compare, create a table for each of the ones mentioned so the group can utilize an organized view of the comparisons.  

Also, write a basic "Hello World" program and `git commit` and `git push` to the remote repository to prove that the group is capable of utilizing Git as a version control tool.

## Individual Goals
<b>Saud and Mary</b>
1. Using an input voltage of 3.3V, build a voltage divider . Draw the circuit, write the general equation in terms of Vout, test on Multisim, build on hardware, and show the results on the multimeter. Be sure to take screenshots and pictures!

2. Now that you've built a voltage divider, build a Wheatstone bridge. Again, write the general equation in terms of Vout, test on Multisim, build on hardware, and show the results on the multimeter for each side of the Wheatstone bridge. Be sure to take screenshots and pictures!

Note: if you can't see the photo, try downloading it, or view in light-mode.

<b>Owen and Udaya</b>
1. When looking at the pinouts of the ESP32 and Raspberry Pi, start thinking about the potential protocols that need to be utilized for the communication between the hardware to the microcontrollers to the software. Also, keep looking into the different software packages/modules that might need to utilized to deliver the most optimal results.  

2. Research how git branching can be utilized to benefit the software development.  

3. Another beneficial topic to look at is the setup of both the Raspberry Pi and ESP32 for enterprise networks, such as eduroam and PAWS-Secure, as they follow different protocol rules for setting up the internet on those devices.  

4. For basic website and app development research, this will be a good start:  https://csci4300-web-programming.github.io/UGA-WebDAWGS-Docs-Pages/ 

## Final Thoughts
I will work to have deliverables for you by the beginning of Tuesday of each week, with an aim to be complete with each deliverable by the next Tuesday. Also, I will make an effort to answer any questions you have regarding of the deliverable goals. Finally, I will routinely join one of your meetings every TWO weeks, but this frequency could increase/decrease based on project needs.
