# Deliverable 6 - Complete in the future

## Hardware Deliverable
1. You used op-amps before. What's inside an op-amp, you ask? Transistors! Using transistors, build the following:

        </p>
    </li>

</ul>

Demonstrate competency by showing the response on the oscilloscope. A chart of the voltage values obtained needs to be made to clearly show what voltage response constitutes the logic of an AND, OR, and NOT gate. 

Best way to start: **Multisim** or **Simulink**

## Software Deliverable

1. Develop lightweight algorithms that iterate through a dataset. 
2. Continue UI development.
