# Deliverable 3 - Complete by 11/3/2025 
As a note, make sure deliverables are completed <b>BEFORE</b> your next meeting! This allows me to help you debug circuits or code by the time I get to the meeting.

## Hardware Deliverable
1. Take a look at the 741 operational amplifier and its datasheet. In the Circuits lab, it can be found as the TL081CP integrated circuit (IC) chip. The op-amp could be an important component in the signal processing steps of this project. There are many video resources that can also help you with this.  

To get you started, use this: https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/opamp/opamp_1.html

    <vspace>
    As a proof of learning, build an inverting amplifier, with an input voltage of your choice. Size the resistors appropriately to achieve a gain of 10 (you'll learn what this is as you read datasheets and other resources).  
    <vspace>
    Hint: Because it is an inverting amplifier, the output voltage should be negative on a multimeter.

2. As there is an inverting amplifier, there is also a non-inverting amplifier. Build one with an input voltage of your choice, but again, size the resistors properly to achieve a gain of 10. 

3. You all built a passive low-pass filter for the last two weeks. Apply that knowledge to build an active low-pass filter. Results ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE REPRESENTED ON AN OSCILLOSCOPE. Show me the process how you are obtaining the data.

#### Note
I need to see visuals - graphs you obtain, calculations that you took, circuit diagrams, etc.

## Software Deliverable 
1. Complete 3 LeetCode problems.
2. Design a basic UI for the screen. Wireframe using Figma or another tool of your choice, then implement it on the small screen.
