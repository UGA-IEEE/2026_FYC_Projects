# Deliverable 4 - Complete by 11/17/2025 
As a note, make sure deliverables are completed <b>BEFORE</b> your next meeting! This allows me to help you debug circuits or code by the time I get to the meeting.

## Hardware Deliverable
1. You used op-amps last week. What's inside an op-amp, you ask? Transistors! Using transistors, build the following:

    <li> NOT Gate

            <img alt="NOT gate" src="./img/NOT-gate.webp">
        </p>
    </li>
    <li> AND Gate
        <p align="center">
            <img alt="AND gate" src="./img/AND-gate.webp">
        </p>
    </li>
    <li> OR Gate
        <p align="center">
            <img alt="OR gate" src="./img/OR-gate.webp">
        </p>
    </li>

</ul>

Demonstrate competency by showing the response on the oscilloscope. A chart of the voltage values obtained needs to be made to clearly show what voltage response constitutes the logic of an AND, OR, and NOT gate. 

Best way to start: **Multisim** or **Simulink**

2. Build a comparator using 4 op-amps (look for TL084 in Driftmier 1450).

As per usual, build on Multisim/Simulink, test with an oscilloscope on the simulation, then build on hardware and test. Charts are absolutely necessary here again. 

Describe what is happening in each portion of the circuit. 

3. Research how a PCB works and best practices when developing a PCB. As Omar discussed, the placement of components on a PCB matters. 

#### Note
I need to see visuals - graphs you obtain, calculations that you took, circuit diagrams, etc.

## Software Deliverable 
1. Continue the development of the UI. Show me screenshots of the initial design.

2. As discussed with Neel, look for more datasets that you can work with. Integrate them into your program. Print out the following statistics: average heart rate, average sleep time. 

3. *(Optional, but recommended)* Complete 2 LeetCode problems.
